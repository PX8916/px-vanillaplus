# px-vanillaplus

- My own take on Vanilla for GZDoom.
- Recommended for those who use compatibility settings and/or playing vanilla WADs that do not modify any actors via Dehacked.
- Has a few more extra features such as weapon casings, alternative chaingun sounds, ID24 and Legacy of Rust support (work in progress)

- Assets by id Software, Nightdive Studios, Bethesda

- Code modifications, Shotgun shell casings edits, Super Shotgun pixel removal by PX8916

# Recommendations:

- Doom Sound Bulb - SeanTheBermanator
- Higher quality SFX, personally better than Perkristian's.

- One Hell of a Marine - Skelegant
- Refined visuals, sounds (including alternative chaingun sounds!), same in function!

- Monster Sounds EX+ - BLUE VERTIGO
- Expands upon the monster bestiary's sounds and even beyond!
